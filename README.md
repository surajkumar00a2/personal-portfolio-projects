# 📂 Data Engineering Portfolio – Suraj Kumar

Production-grade data engineering projects demonstrating **end-to-end pipelines, cloud-native architectures, orchestration, and data quality / observability engineering**.

This repository is intentionally structured as a **portfolio monorepo**, where each project is self-contained and documented independently.

## 📊 Featured Projects

### 1. 🌦️ Weather Data Platform with Quality Monitoring (AWS)
**Tech:** Python, AWS Lambda, S3, Glue, Athena, CloudWatch  
📁 Folder: `weather_data_platform`

A **serverless data lake** built on AWS that ingests weather data and continuously monitors **data quality, schema drift, and anomalies** at ingestion time.

**Why this project stands out**
- Goes beyond ingestion to focus on **data trust & observability**
- Detects upstream API issues *before* dashboards break
- Fully event-driven, cost-optimized, and production-oriented

**Key Capabilities**
- Bronze → Silver → Gold ETL architecture
- Real-time data quality metrics (completeness, consistency, timeliness)
- Schema drift detection
- CloudWatch dashboards & alerts
- IAM-secured, serverless design
- ~$1.6/month AWS cost (Free Tier friendly)
